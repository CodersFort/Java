## Find Closest Value In BST

#### Problem Statement


You are given a BST data structure consisting of BST nodes. Each BST node has an integer value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored
in properties called "left" and "right," respectively. A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satises the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the
values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and both of its children nodes are either BST nodes
themselves or None (null) values. You are also given a target integer value; write a function that nds the closest value to that target value contained in the BST.
Assume that there will only be one closest value.
Sample input:
        10 , 12
       /  \
      5   15
     / \   / \
    2   5 13 22
   /        \
  1         14
Sample output: 13
