## Validate BST

#### Problem Statement


You are given a Binary Tree data structure consisting of Binary Tree nodes. Each Binary Tree node has an integer value stored in a property called "value" and two
children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right," respectively. Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves or the None (null) value. Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether or not the Binary Tree is a valid BST. A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satises the BST
property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and both of its
children nodes are either BST nodes themselves or None (null) values.

Sample input:
            10
           /  \
          5   15
         / \  / \
        2   5 13 22
       /       \
      1        14
      
Sample output: True
