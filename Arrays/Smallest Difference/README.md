# SmallestDifference

Write a function that takes in two non-empty arrays of integers. The function should find the pair of numbers (one from the 1st array, one from the 2nd array)
whose absolute difference is closest to zero. The function should return an array containing these two numbers, with the number from the 1st array in the 1st.
position. Assume that there will only be one pair of numbers with the smallest difference.
Sample input: [-1, 5, 10, 20, 28, 3], [26, 134, 135, 15, 17]
Sample output: [28, 26]
