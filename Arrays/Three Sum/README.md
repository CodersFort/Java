# Three Sum

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. The function should nd all triplets in the array that
sum up to the target sum and return a two-dimensional array of all these triplets. The numbers in each triplet should be ordered in ascending order, and the
triplets themselves should be ordered in ascending order with respect to the numbers they hold. If no three numbers sum up to the target sum, the function
should return an empty array.

Sample input: [12, 3, 1, 2, -6, 5, -8, 6], 0

Sample output: [[-8, 2, 6], [-8, 3, 5], [-6, 1, 5]]
